## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:13:27.731Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:13:28.731Z)

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:13:29.731Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:13:30.731Z)

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and it's completely understandable to feel that way. It's a testament to your love for Emma and your family that you're juggling so many complex emotions. The fact that you're even asking these questions shows how much you care. And please know, wanting to escape sometimes doesn't make you terrible at all – it makes you human, especially when you're under this much pressure. Let's try to visualize these different feelings and pressures you're under. Perhaps a stress map could help us see everything in one place?

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:13:32.731Z)

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: That's fantastic that you hit your goal of running three times this week! It's completely normal to feel a mix of pride and frustration. Be proud of yourself for pushing through and achieving it, and let's acknowledge that the 'annoyance' comes from knowing how good it makes you feel, and the struggle it took to get there. This is a great step!

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:53:11.811Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel all those things at once – pride in Emma's effort, frustration with the challenges, guilt about not noticing sooner, and worry mixed with hope for her future. That's a lot to hold, and it's okay to feel it all.

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, and it's completely understandable that a positive event like the investor meeting is overshadowed by everything else. Let's try to untangle some of that stress.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T02:53:15.811Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's not terrible at all. Feeling overwhelmed and wanting a break is a very human response when you're juggling so much. You're a dedicated parent, and even wanting a moment to yourself doesn't diminish that love.

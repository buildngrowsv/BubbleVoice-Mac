User is feeling overwhelmed by work stress (investor stuff) and exhaustion, which is impacting their ability to maintain personal goals (running) and relationship needs (date night with Jordan). They are also carrying guilt about not being present enough due to these pressures. The positive development with Emma's reading is a bright spot but doesn't negate the overall stress. Need to acknowledge the overwhelm and gently encourage small, manageable steps.

**Key Context**: User is experiencing burnout from startup stress and personal responsibilities, leading to neglect of self-care and relationship.

**Watch For**: Continued struggle with work-life balance, prioritization of personal goals, and relationship needs. Look for opportunities to break down tasks and encourage self-compassion.

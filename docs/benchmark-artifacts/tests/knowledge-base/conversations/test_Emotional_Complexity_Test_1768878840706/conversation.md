## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T03:14:00.706Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel all those things at once – pride, frustration, guilt, worry, and hope. It sounds like you're navigating a lot right now, and it's a testament to your love for Emma that you're so invested in her progress.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T03:14:04.706Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's not terrible at all. Wanting a break is a natural human feeling, especially when you're juggling so much. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and need some space, which is completely valid. You're a dedicated parent, and even the thought of needing a break doesn't diminish that.

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: That's fantastic that you hit your goal of running three times this week! It's completely understandable to feel both amazing from the accomplishment and a bit annoyed at the struggle to maintain consistency. Your dedication to yourself is really showing.

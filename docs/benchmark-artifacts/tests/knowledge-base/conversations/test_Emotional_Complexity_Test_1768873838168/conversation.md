**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Wanting a break, or even a moment to escape, doesn't mean you don't love your kids. It means you're human and you're carrying a lot. Many parents feel exactly like this when they're overwhelmed. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge them without judgment.

It's a sign of a strong relationship that you're noticing this and wanting to give Jordan the attention they deserve. Let's acknowledge that feeling and think about how to nurture that connection.

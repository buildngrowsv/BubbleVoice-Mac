The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:10:34.150Z)

I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

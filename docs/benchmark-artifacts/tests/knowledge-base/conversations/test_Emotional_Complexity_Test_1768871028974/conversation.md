**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

**AI**: It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and it's completely understandable that even good news like a successful investor meeting can get overshadowed by the weight of everything else. It takes a lot of strength to keep going when you're feeling this overwhelmed. Let's try to untangle some of this stress. Would you like to start by mapping out what's contributing to this feeling?

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:03:51.974Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:03:52.974Z)

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're juggling so much. Wanting to escape is a sign of how much pressure you're under, not a reflection of your love for your kids. Many parents feel this way when they're feeling overwhelmed. Let's acknowledge that feeling and then see if we can find some ways to ease the pressure.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T01:03:54.974Z)

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: That's fantastic that you hit your running goal three times this week! It's completely normal to feel a mix of amazing and annoyed – the 'amazing' comes from the proven benefits, and the 'annoyed' comes from the struggle to get there consistently. It sounds like a testament to your commitment that you pushed through, even when it was hard.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:47:10.383Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel all those things at once – pride, frustration, guilt, worry, and hope. It sounds like you're navigating a lot right now, and it's wonderful that you're so attuned to Emma's needs and progress.

**AI**: It's incredibly common to feel overwhelmed and wish for a break, even when you deeply love your children. You're not terrible for having these feelings; it's a sign that you're carrying a heavy load and need some respite.

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

**AI**: It sounds like you're really appreciating Jordan's support and recognizing the need to be more present. It's natural to feel that way when you're stretched thin. What small step could you take to nurture that connection?

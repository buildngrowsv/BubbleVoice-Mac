User is feeling overwhelmed by multiple stressors: work (startup, investors), parenting (Emma's reading progress, though positive, still a concern), and personal well-being (exercise, relationship). User is experiencing burnout. The positive note about Emma's reading is a good anchor to start from.

**Emotional State**: exhausted, stressed, overwhelmed

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T00:58:09.812Z)

User wants to discuss Emma's reading progress, but also remembered the kitchen renovation. I've confirmed the decision to postpone the kitchen renovation, referencing the date and the reasoning (fundraising uncertainty). This addresses the user's quick question and allows us to transition back to Emma.

**Emotional State**: calm, seeking prioritization

**Key Context**: User is feeling overwhelmed and needs to address priorities. Kitchen renovation is on hold due to startup funding.

**Watch For**: User's ability to delegate or say no, and any small steps towards self-care or relationship focus.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:58:11.933Z)

User is feeling overwhelmed by multiple demands. They've listed several key stressors: Max's game, Emma's teacher meeting, startup Q1 numbers, and lack of exercise. They've explicitly stated they 'don't even know where to start.' I need to validate their feelings and offer a clear path forward by suggesting a starting point, linking back to Emma's progress or prioritizing the urgent startup task.

**Emotional State**: overwhelmed, stressed

**Key Context**: User is experiencing significant overwhelm due to overlapping responsibilities and needs help prioritizing and finding a starting point.

**Watch For**: User's ability to delegate, their self-care practices, and how they navigate the stress of the startup.

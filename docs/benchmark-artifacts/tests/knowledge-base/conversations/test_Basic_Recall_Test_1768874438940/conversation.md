**User**: What did Dr. Chen say about guilt?

**AI**: Dr. Chen described guilt as 'borrowed suffering.' She explained that you're essentially punishing yourself for something that isn't your fault, and that it's common to feel this way, especially when trying to balance so many things. She also noted that catching Emma's reading challenges in 2nd grade is actually quite early, which is a positive.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T00:37:41.135Z)

User is expressing overwhelm from multiple life areas: Emma's school (positive progress), startup (high stress), personal goals (struggling with exercise), and partner relationship (neglected). They are feeling the effects of burnout and guilt. The positive update on Emma's reading is a good anchor point.

**Emotional State**: exhausted, overwhelmed, stressed, guilty

**Key Context**: User is experiencing significant burnout across multiple domains, despite a positive development with Emma's reading. The core tension is between the desire to address all needs (work, family, self-care, relationship) and the current lack of energy/time.

**Watch For**: Continue to monitor the user's stress levels, particularly regarding the startup and their ability to maintain self-care (running) and relationship (date night) commitments. Look for opportunities to help them delegate or simplify.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T00:37:43.215Z)

User wants to discuss Emma's reading but also asked about the kitchen. I've confirmed the decision to postpone the kitchen renovation, which was previously documented. The primary focus should now shift back to Emma's reading progress. The user is still feeling the effects of burnout, so I need to be mindful of that while discussing Emma's situation.

**Emotional State**: overwhelmed, slightly anxious about kitchen delay, but also relieved to have confirmation

**Key Context**: User is juggling multiple stressors (work, family, personal goals) and is seeking to discuss Emma's progress. Kitchen renovation is on hold as decided.

**Watch For**: User's energy levels and continued feelings of overwhelm. Look for opportunities to validate their efforts and suggest small, manageable steps.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:37:50.535Z)

The user is expressing a high level of overwhelm, listing multiple competing demands across different life areas (Max's activities, Emma's school, startup, personal health). They are feeling the strain of trying to manage everything. The mention of Q1 numbers suggests immediate pressure from the startup. I need to help them break this down and find a starting point.

**Emotional State**: overwhelmed, stressed, potentially guilty

**Key Context**: User is feeling overwhelmed by multiple, simultaneous demands across family, work, and personal goals. Immediate pressure from startup Q1 numbers.

**Watch For**: User's ability to prioritize and delegate. Look for signs of burnout. Need to help them identify one manageable step.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:05:53.436Z)

**User**: Have I been keeping up with my running goal?

**AI**: Let's check in on your running goal. It looks like you set a goal to run 3 times a week, and you had one really good week in mid-January where you hit that! However, consistency has been a challenge, with you averaging about once a week. The main barriers you've mentioned are being too tired after work, juggling kids' schedules, and sometimes a dip in motivation. 

Regarding the startup, you're in the middle of a fundraising push. You've pitched 8 investors so far, with 2 showing genuine interest after initial meetings. However, you also faced a tough rejection from 3 investors on January 15th, which understandably led to some self-doubt. You're also trying to hire a senior engineer, but finding the right candidate has been difficult, and the product development is falling behind schedule.

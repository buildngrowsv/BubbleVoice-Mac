**User**: What patterns have you noticed about my stress?

**AI**: I've noticed a few patterns in your stress. It often surfaces when there are scheduling conflicts, like Max's practice overlapping with Emma's tutoring, and it's amplified by concerns about Emma's reading progress and the pressure of fundraising for your startup. These external pressures seem to compound, making you feel overwhelmed.

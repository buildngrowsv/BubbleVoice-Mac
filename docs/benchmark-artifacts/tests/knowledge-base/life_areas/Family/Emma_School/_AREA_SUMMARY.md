## Current Situation

Emma (7yo, 2nd grade) has been struggling with reading comprehension for about 2 weeks now. She can decode words fine but doesn't retain what she reads. Teacher (Ms. Johnson) noticed and scheduled a meeting. Major breakthrough came when we tried graphic novels - she read Dog Man for 20 minutes straight! This suggests visual learning style might be key. User is worried about testing for learning differences but also wants to help.

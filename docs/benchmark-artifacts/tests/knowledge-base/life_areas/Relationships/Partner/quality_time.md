**Conversation Context**: Evening reflection

Kids were at grandparents for a few hours. Jordan and I actually sat down for dinner together. We talked about real stuff, not just logistics. It was really nice.

**User Quote**: "I forgot how much I like just talking to Jordan."

**AI Observation**: Small moments of connection matter. User and Jordan are solid - just need to protect time together.

**Sentiment**: connected

**Conversation Context**: Late night conversation

Jordan and I talked about how we've been ships passing in the night. Agreed we need to prioritize date nights but neither of us has bandwidth to plan them.

**User Quote**: "We both know we need this but we're too tired to do anything about it."

**AI Observation**: Both partners are aware of the issue. Low-effort connection ideas might help (movie at home, order in, etc).

**Sentiment**: tired

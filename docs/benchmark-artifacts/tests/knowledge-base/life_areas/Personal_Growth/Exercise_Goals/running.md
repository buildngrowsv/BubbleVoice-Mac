**Conversation Context**: End of week reflection

Didn't run at all this week. Too tired after work, then Emma's homework takes forever, by the time kids are in bed I just want to collapse.

**User Quote**: "I keep failing at this goal."

**AI Observation**: Self-criticism not helping. Need to reframe as "busy week" not "failure". Perhaps morning runs would work better than evening.

**Sentiment**: disappointed

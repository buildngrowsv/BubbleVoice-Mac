However, consistency has been a challenge, with you averaging about once a week. The main barriers you've mentioned are being too tired after work, juggling kids' schedules, and sometimes a dip in motivation. \n\nRegarding the startup, you're in the middle of a fundraising push. You've pitched 8 investors so far, with 2 showing genuine interest after initial meetings. However, you also faced a tough rejection from 3 investors on January 15th, which understandably led to some self-doubt. You're also trying to hire a senior engineer, but finding the right candidate has been difficult, and the product development is falling behind schedule.",

        "current_situation": "Emma (7yo, 2nd grade) struggled with reading comprehension, decoding words but not retaining information. This led to frustration and self-doubt. A major breakthrough occurred with graphic novels (Dog Man), showing a potential visual learning style. Teacher meeting is scheduled. User is proud of progress but anxious about testing and Emma's self-esteem. Strategies include visual aids, reading together, and effort-based praise. Emma has shown increased interest in reading, even asking for extra chapters, which is a significant positive sign. User is exploring ways to support Emma without making her feel 'broken'. However, the user is also feeling burnt out from startup stress and guilt about not noticing Emma's struggles sooner. The startup context is adding to the overall stress, making it hard to balance work and family needs. Partner is supportive, but the user feels the pressure of being the primary caregiver and decision-maker for Emma's education. The user needs reassurance that testing is a tool for understanding, not a label. Need to help user manage guilt and burnout. Therapy sessions are ongoing to address these feelings. Focus on celebrating small wins and reinforcing Emma's growing confidence. The user is looking for strategies to help Emma without causing her undue stress or anxiety about her learning abilities.

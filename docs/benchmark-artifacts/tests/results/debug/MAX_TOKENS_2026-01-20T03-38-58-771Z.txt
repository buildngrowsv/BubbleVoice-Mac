        "user_quote": "How's Emma's reading been going? She had a breakthrough with Dog Man, but I'm still worried about the teacher meeting next week. I don't want her to feel like she's broken if they test her. She threw her book and said 'I'm stupid' the other day, and it broke my heart. But then she asked to read more Dog Man! It's so confusing. I'm trying to praise her effort, and it seems to be helping. I just want her to feel good about reading, not scared. I'm also worried about how this will affect her self-esteem. She's so sensitive. I'm trying to stay positive for her, but it's hard. I just hope the teacher meeting goes well. I'm trying to prepare for it by looking at strategies that work, like reading together and using visual aids. I really hope this helps her confidence. It feels like a rollercoaster. One minute she's reading enthusiastically, the next she's shutting down. It's hard to know what to do for the best. I'm worried I'm pushing too hard or not hard enough. I just want to support her in the best way possible. I'm going to keep encouraging her with the graphic novels and positive reinforcement.

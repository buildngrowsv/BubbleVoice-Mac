The user is still processing this, intellectually understanding but emotionally struggling to let go of the guilt. \n\nUSER_QUOTE: \"I know she's right but it's hard to believe.\"\nAI_OBSERVATION: User is receptive to the insight but still needs time to emotionally integrate it. The concept of 'borrowed suffering' is a powerful reframing tool. It's important to acknowledge the difficulty in letting go of ingrained guilt patterns.\nSENTIMENT: reflective, concerned about guilt but hopeful about the insight."

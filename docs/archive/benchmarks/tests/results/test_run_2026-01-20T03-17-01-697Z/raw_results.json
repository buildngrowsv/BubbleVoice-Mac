We still have that teacher meeting coming up though, so I'm a little anxious about what that will bring. I just want to make sure she gets the right support without feeling singled out or broken. It’s a fine line, you know? She’s only 7, and I don’t want to put too much pressure on her. But I also don’t want to miss any opportunities to help her succeed. It’s a lot to juggle, the startup and Emma’s school stuff, and trying to be present for my partner too. It’s overwhelming sometimes, but seeing her light up when she reads is the best reward. I'm so proud of her for sticking with it and for her resilience. We’ll see what the teacher says next week. I’m preparing myself for whatever outcome, but I’m choosing to focus on the positive progress we’ve made so far. I’m glad we’re doing this, it’s important. Thank you for listening and helping me process everything. It means a lot. I’m going to try and take some deep breaths and just be present for her tonight. Thanks again, Bubble! You’re the best. Talk to you soon. Bye for now! 😊💖🌟✨💫"

This pressure is a significant contributor to the user's overall stress levels, often leading to feelings of overwhelm and burnout. The user is actively seeking investment but facing rejections alongside positive investor meetings, creating an emotional rollercoaster. The need to balance startup demands with family responsibilities is a constant challenge, particularly with Emma's academic needs adding to the mental load. The user is also managing personal goals like running, which are currently a struggle due to fatigue and time constraints. Therapy sessions are focused on work-life balance, parenting guilt, and burnout prevention. Despite these efforts, the user expresses feeling like they should be further along in managing these challenges, indicating a persistent internal pressure to perform and succeed across all life domains. The user's focus is heavily on work and Emma's needs, with less attention on personal wellness goals like running, which are often deprioritized. Max's soccer activities are a source of positive family moments but also contribute to scheduling complexities. Quality time with partner is an area that needs active cultivation amidst the chaos. Kitchen renovation is on hold, indicating a prioritization of more immediate concerns."

Like, I know we had that breakthrough with the Dog Man books which was amazing, she was so engaged and happy, but then yesterday she had homework and it was back to the struggle again. And I keep wondering if I'm doing enough, you know? Like maybe I should have noticed sooner that she was having trouble. Her teacher Ms. Johnson is great but she mentioned testing and I'm just... I don't know how I feel about that. On one hand I want to help Emma in every way possible but on the other hand I don't want her to feel like there's something wrong with her. She's already so hard on herself. Remember when she threw that book and said she was stupid? That just broke my heart. And then there's the whole thing with work which is just insane right now. The investors are breathing down our necks for these Q1 numbers and I'm like, we're doing our best but it's a startup, you know? Things take time. We had those rejections which sucked but then that second meeting went well so I'm cautiously optimistic but also terrified. And my co-founder keeps pushing for this new feature that I think is too ambitious right now but I don't want to seem like I'm not thinking big enough. Plus we still haven't found that senior engineer we need. We've interviewed like five people and nobody feels right. And on top of all that I'm just exhausted. I haven't been running at all, maybe once in the last two weeks? I know I feel better when I run, I know that, but by the time I get home from work and deal with Emma's homework and Max's soccer stuff I'm just done. Speaking of Max, he has a game on Saturday and I promised I'd be there but I also have this investor call that might conflict and I don't know what to do. Jordan has been amazing through all of this but I feel like we're just ships passing in the night. We haven't had a real conversation in days, let alone a date night. I miss us, you know? And my mom called yesterday asking about Thanksgiving plans and I haven't even thought that far ahead. I can barely think about next week. Oh and the kitchen renovation, we put that on hold obviously but every time I walk into that kitchen I'm reminded that it's not done and it's just another thing on the list of things I'm not dealing with. I feel like I'm dropping balls everywhere and I don't know which one to pick up first. Is this normal? Like, does everyone feel this overwhelmed or am I just bad at managing my life?",

Max will be so disappointed if I'm not there but this investor could be really important for the company. And if the company fails then what? Then I've sacrificed all this family time for nothing. But if I don't take the investor seriously then maybe we don't get funding and the company fails anyway. It's like I can't win. And Emma, I just want to make sure she knows she's smart and capable even if reading is hard for her. I don't want this to define her, you know? She's so creative and funny and kind. The reading thing is just one thing. But I also don't want to ignore it if she needs help. I'm just scared of making the wrong choice. With the testing, with the investors, with everything.

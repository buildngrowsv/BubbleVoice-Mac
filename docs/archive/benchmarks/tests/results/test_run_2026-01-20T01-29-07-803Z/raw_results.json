The graphic novels are still a huge hit, and she's been more engaged than ever. We even had a moment where she asked to read *more* after her chapter was done, which was a first! The teacher meeting is scheduled for next week, and you're wisely preparing to make sure you have all the context. For the startup, we've had two investor meetings go well recently, but we're still facing rejections from others. Hiring a senior engineer is proving difficult, and product development is behind schedule. I'm feeling the burnout from trying to balance everything, especially with Emma's reading struggles and Max's soccer season. It feels like I'm not doing enough for anyone. My partner is supportive, but I still feel the pressure. I need to remember that I'm doing my best and that it's okay to not be perfect. I'm also still feeling guilty about not asking for help, even though I know I should. My therapy session last week focused on this guilt, and I'm trying to be more mindful of my mental health and not push myself too hard. I'm also trying to make sure we have quality time with my partner, but it's hard to find the energy after a long day. This is all taking a toll, and I need to find a way to manage my stress better. I'm also looking for ways to improve my running, as it's something I enjoy and it helps me clear my head. I'm trying to stick to a schedule, but it's been a struggle lately. I'm also trying to renovate my kitchen, but it's on hold right now due to everything else going on. I know I need to focus on what's most important right now, and that's Emma and the startup. But I also need to take care of myself. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and I'm not sure how to prioritize everything. "

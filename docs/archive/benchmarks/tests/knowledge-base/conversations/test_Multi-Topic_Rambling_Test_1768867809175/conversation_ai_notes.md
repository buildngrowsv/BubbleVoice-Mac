The user is expressing overwhelm from multiple life areas: work (startup stress, investors), family (Emma's reading progress is positive but the general context is stressful), personal growth (desire to run but too tired), and relationships (lack of date nights). They are feeling the strain of trying to manage everything.

The user wants to shift focus to Emma's reading progress, but also briefly touched on the kitchen renovation.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:10:09.174Z)

The user is feeling overwhelmed by multiple competing priorities: Max's activities, Emma's school, startup demands, and personal goals. They explicitly stated they 'don't even know where to start' and that 'everything is just a lot'. This indicates a high level of stress and a need for prioritization. I need to help them break this down and identify what to focus on first.

**Emotional State**: overwhelmed

**Key Context**: User is experiencing significant overwhelm from multiple life areas and needs help prioritizing.

**Watch For**: Which area the user chooses to focus on first. Monitor startup stress as it's consistently high. Note any progress or continued struggle with exercise goals.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:06:50.676Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:06:51.676Z)

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. It's completely understandable to feel that way, even when good things happen. The stress from other areas can overshadow the positive moments. Let's acknowledge all those feelings – the pride for Emma, the frustration with her struggles, the guilt, the worry, and the hope. They're all valid and part of this complex picture.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:06:53.676Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's not terrible at all. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and need a break. Those feelings are incredibly common for parents, especially when you're juggling so much. It doesn't mean you don't love your kids; it means you're human and carrying a heavy load. It's okay to want a moment to yourself.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T01:06:55.676Z)

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

**AI**: It sounds like you really appreciate Jordan's support, and it's natural to feel a pang of guilt when you feel you haven't been as present as you'd like. It shows how much you value them and the relationship. What does 'better' look like to you in this context?

## Turn 4 (2026-01-20T01:06:57.676Z)

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: That's fantastic that you hit your goal of running three times this week! It's completely understandable to feel that mix of accomplishment and annoyance. You know how good it makes you feel, and it's frustrating when life gets in the way. Let's celebrate the win first – you did it! We can then look at what made this week successful and how to carry that momentum forward.

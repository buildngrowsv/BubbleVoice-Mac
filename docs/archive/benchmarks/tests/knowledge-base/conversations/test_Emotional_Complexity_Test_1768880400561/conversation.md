## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T03:40:00.561Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel such a mix of emotions right now – pride in Emma's effort, frustration with the challenges, guilt about not noticing sooner, worry for her future, and hope from the graphic novel breakthrough. That's a lot to hold, and it shows how much you care.

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's completely normal to feel that way sometimes. Parenting is incredibly demanding, and wanting a moment of escape doesn't make you a terrible person. It's a sign that you need a break and some time for yourself. You're doing a great job, and it's okay to acknowledge when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Be proud of the progress you've made!

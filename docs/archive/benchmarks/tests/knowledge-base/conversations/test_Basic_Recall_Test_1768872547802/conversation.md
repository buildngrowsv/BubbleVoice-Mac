## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:29:08.802Z)

**User**: Remind me what's happening with the startup fundraising?

**AI**: Emma's reading has shown some really promising signs lately! Remember how we talked about the graphic novels being a breakthrough? They're still a huge hit, and she's been more engaged than ever. We even had a moment where she asked to read *more* after her chapter was done, which was a first! The teacher meeting is scheduled for next week, and you're wisely preparing to make sure you have all the context.

**User**: Have I been keeping up with my running goal?

**AI**: You've been having a tough time keeping up with your running goal lately. You mentioned being too tired after work and with the kids' schedules, which is completely understandable. You did hit your goal of running 3x a week in mid-January, which was a great week!

**User**: What did Dr. Chen say about guilt?

**AI**: Dr. Chen said that guilt is 'borrowed suffering.' She explained that you're essentially punishing yourself for something that isn't your fault, especially in situations like Emma's reading challenges, which are common and not something you caused.

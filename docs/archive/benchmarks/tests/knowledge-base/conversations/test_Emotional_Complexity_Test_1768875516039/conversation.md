## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:18:36.039Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:18:37.039Z)

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:18:38.039Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and wish for a break. Many parents feel this way. It doesn't make you a terrible person; it makes you human. You're juggling so much right now with Emma's reading, the startup, and everything else. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load.

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

**AI**: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of appreciation for Jordan's support and guilt about not being as present as you'd like. It's completely normal to feel that way when you're juggling so much.

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: It's fantastic that you hit your running goal three times this week and are feeling the positive effects! It's completely understandable to feel a bit annoyed with yourself when you know something is so beneficial but still find it a struggle to maintain. That's a really common feeling.

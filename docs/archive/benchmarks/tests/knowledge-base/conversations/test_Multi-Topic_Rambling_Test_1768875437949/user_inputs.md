## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T02:17:17.949Z)

So Emma had a good day today with reading but I'm exhausted from work and the investor stuff is stressing me out and I really should go for a run but I'm too tired and Jordan and I haven't had a date night in forever

Yeah let's talk about Emma actually, but also quick question - did we ever figure out what to do about the kitchen?

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T02:17:21.949Z)

I don't even know where to start honestly, everything is just a lot right now. Max has a game Saturday, Emma has her teacher meeting next week, the startup needs those Q1 numbers, and I haven't exercised in like two weeks

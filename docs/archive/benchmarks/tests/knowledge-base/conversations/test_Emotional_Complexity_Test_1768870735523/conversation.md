## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T00:58:55.523Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T00:58:56.523Z)

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a really heavy load right now, juggling pride in your accomplishments with the weight of all these other stresses. It's completely understandable that you can't fully enjoy the good news from the investor meeting when so much else is demanding your attention.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T00:58:58.523Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Loving your kids doesn't mean you don't also need space and a break for yourself. Those feelings are a sign that you're overwhelmed and need a moment to recharge, not that you're a terrible person. Many parents feel this way when they're under a lot of stress.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:59:00.523Z)

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:59:01.523Z)

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: That's fantastic that you hit your running goal three times this week! It's completely understandable to feel both amazing from the accomplishment and a bit annoyed at yourself for the struggle to get there. It's a common pattern when something clearly benefits you, yet it still feels like a battle to maintain. Be proud of the progress you made this week!

**User**: I'm really worried about Emma. She's in 2nd grade and struggling with reading. Her teacher said she can decode words but doesn't remember what she reads.

**AI**: I'm so sorry to hear you're worried about Emma. It sounds like a really tough situation when you know your child is struggling, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as reading. It's good that her teacher has given you some specific feedback – that she can decode words but has trouble with comprehension. That gives us a starting point to think about.

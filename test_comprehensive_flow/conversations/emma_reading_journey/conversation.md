**User**: I'm worried about my daughter Emma. She's in 2nd grade and struggling with reading comprehension.

**AI**: I hear you're worried about Emma. It sounds like you're concerned about her reading comprehension in 2nd grade. That must be tough to see. Can you tell me a bit more about what you've observed or what her teacher has said?

**User**: Her teacher said she can decode words fine, but she doesn't remember what she reads. Like she'll read a whole page and then can't tell me what happened.

**AI**: I see. So, she can sound out the words, but the meaning isn't sticking. That's a common challenge, and it can be really frustrating for both the child and the parent. Have you noticed if this happens with all types of reading, or only certain kinds of books or materials?

## Turn 3 (2026-01-26 01:23:37)

**User**: We've been working on it for 3 weeks now. I read with her every night, ask questions, but I'm not sure if it's helping.

**AI**: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort every night with reading, and it's understandable to feel uncertain if it's making a difference after three weeks. That dedication is wonderful, though. Have you noticed any small shifts, even if they feel insignificant, or has it felt pretty consistent?

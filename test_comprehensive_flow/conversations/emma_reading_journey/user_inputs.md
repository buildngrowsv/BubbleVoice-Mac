I'm worried about my daughter Emma. She's in 2nd grade and struggling with reading comprehension.

Her teacher said she can decode words fine, but she doesn't remember what she reads. Like she'll read a whole page and then can't tell me what happened.

We've been working on it for 3 weeks now. I read with her every night, ask questions, but I'm not sure if it's helping.

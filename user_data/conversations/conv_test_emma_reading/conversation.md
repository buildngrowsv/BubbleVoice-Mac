**User**: I'm really worried about Emma. She's struggling with reading and I don't know how to help her.

**AI**: I hear you. It can be really worrying when our children struggle with something as important as reading. Tell me more about what you've noticed. What does her struggle look like?

## Turn 2 (2026-01-24 21:28:17)

**User**: She's in 2nd grade. Her teacher said she can decode words but doesn't remember what she reads.

**AI**: It sounds like Emma has the foundational skills for reading, but the comprehension isn't clicking yet. That's actually a specific and helpful observation from her teacher.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-24 21:28:17)

**User**: She had a meltdown yesterday. Threw her book and said 'I'm stupid.' It just broke my heart.

**AI**: That must have been so hard to witness. When children say things like that, it really does break our hearts. Emma's frustration is understandable, but it's also a sign that her self-esteem is being affected.

**User**: I'm really worried about Emma. She's struggling with reading and I don't know how to help her.

**AI**: I hear you. It can be really worrying when our children struggle with something as important as reading. Tell me more about what you've noticed.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-25 01:16:44)

**User**: She's in 2nd grade. Her teacher said she can decode words but doesn't remember what she reads.

**AI**: It sounds like Emma has the foundational skills for reading, but the comprehension isn't clicking yet. That's actually a specific and helpful observation from her teacher.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-25 01:16:44)

**User**: She had a breakthrough yesterday! She read a graphic novel (Dog Man) for 20 minutes straight. I think the pictures help her stay engaged.

**AI**: That's wonderful! It sounds like you've discovered something important about how Emma learns best. Visual elements seem to really help her engage with the content.

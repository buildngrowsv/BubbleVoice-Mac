I'm really worried about Emma. She's struggling with reading and I don't know how to help her.

She's in 2nd grade. Her teacher said she can decode words but doesn't remember what she reads.

She had a breakthrough yesterday! She read a graphic novel (Dog Man) for 20 minutes straight without complaining. I think the pictures help her stay engaged.

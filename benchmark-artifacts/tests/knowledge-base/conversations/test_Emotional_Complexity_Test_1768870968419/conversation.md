## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:02:48.419Z)

**User**: I'm proud of Emma for trying so hard with reading, but also frustrated that it's so hard for her, and guilty that I didn't notice sooner, and worried about what this means for her future, but also hopeful because of the graphic novel thing.

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:02:49.419Z)

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

## Turn 1 (2026-01-20T01:02:50.419Z)

**User**: I love my kids but sometimes I just want to run away. Is that terrible?

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Wanting a moment to escape when things are this intense doesn't make you terrible at all. It sounds like you're feeling a mix of pride, frustration, guilt, worry, and a flicker of hope all at once, and on top of that, the stress from work is overshadowing even the good news. It's a lot for one person to juggle. Let's try to untangle some of this. How about we focus on creating a visual map of all these feelings and stressors? It might help to see it all laid out.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:02:52.419Z)

**User**: Jordan was so supportive last night and I felt bad because I haven't been present lately. They deserve better.

## Turn 2 (2026-01-20T01:02:53.419Z)

**User**: I finally ran three times this week and I feel amazing but also annoyed at myself that this is so hard when it clearly helps so much

**AI**: It's fantastic that you hit your running goal three times this week! It's completely normal to feel both amazing from the accomplishment and a bit annoyed at yourself for the struggle to get there. That feeling of 'why is this so hard when it helps so much?' is something many people experience with self-care. The important thing is that you're making progress and feeling the benefits. Let's capture this win!

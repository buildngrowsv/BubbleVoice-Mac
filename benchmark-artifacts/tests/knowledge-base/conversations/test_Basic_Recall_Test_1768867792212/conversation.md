## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T00:09:56.212Z)

**User**: Have I been keeping up with my running goal?

**AI**: Let's take a look at your running goal. It seems like consistency has been a challenge lately, with an average of about one run per week instead of your goal of three. There was that one great week in mid-January where you hit the goal, which is fantastic! Remember, it's okay to have busy weeks where fitting in runs is tough. The important thing is to acknowledge it and try to get back on track when you can. How does that sit with you?

## Turn 4 (2026-01-20T00:09:58.212Z)

**User**: What did Dr. Chen say about guilt?

**AI**: Dr. Chen said that guilt can be like 'borrowed suffering' – essentially, you're punishing yourself for something that isn't your fault. She also noted that catching Emma's reading challenges in 2nd grade is actually quite early, which is a positive point.

**User**: The investor meeting went well but I can't even feel happy about it because I'm so stressed about everything else

**AI**: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when so many things are weighing on you, even when some things, like the investor meeting, go well. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to not feel happy when other stresses are so present. Let's try to untangle some of this. Would you like to explore these different stressors, or would you prefer to focus on a specific area first?

Many parents feel this way when they're overwhelmed. Your love for your kids is evident, and these feelings are a sign of the immense pressure you're under.

You know how much it helps you, and yet making it happen consistently is a struggle. It sounds like you're recognizing a pattern here – the effort is high, but the payoff is significant.

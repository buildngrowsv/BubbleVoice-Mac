**User**: So Emma had a good day today with reading but I'm exhausted from work and the investor stuff is stressing me out and I really should go for a run but I'm too tired and Jordan and I haven't had a date night in forever

**AI**: It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now. Emma's reading progress is wonderful news, but it's completely understandable that you're feeling exhausted and stressed with work and the investor stuff. It's also tough when your own goals, like running and date nights with Jordan, fall by the wayside because you're running on empty.

## Turn 3 (2026-01-20T01:06:08.113Z)

**User**: I don't even know where to start honestly, everything is just a lot right now. Max has a game Saturday, Emma has her teacher meeting next week, the startup needs those Q1 numbers, and I haven't exercised in like two weeks

**AI**: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed with so many things demanding your attention. It's completely understandable to not know where to start when everything feels like a lot. Let's take a breath and focus on one thing at a time. We can break this down.
